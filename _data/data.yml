career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a research and data specialist based in the Netherlands, with almost ten years of work experience as a journalist, researcher, and more recently, a data analyst in the academic publishing sector. I wrote my award-winning thesis in Middle Eastern Studies between Leiden University and Sabancı University (Istanbul). I thrive in a close-knit team, but I am reliable and accurate when working independently. Finding that one, seemingly trivial detail that blurs the picture and telling compelling stories is what I do best.
